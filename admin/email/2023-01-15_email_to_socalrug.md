# Introduction to Stochastic Processes Course

Hello SoCal RUG

We are excited that Dr. Olga is back for another full day, in person stats course. It will take place on Saturday 2023-02-11 at UCI. All the details can be found on the [Eventbrite page](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/socal-rug-introduction-to-stochastic-processes-tickets-515333254637) and the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/socalrug/stochastic_processes_2023-02-11).

The course will cover stochastic processes. So what are stochastic processes? The word stochastic is jargon for random. A stochastic process is a system which evolves in time while undergoing chance fluctuations. We can describe such a system by defining a family of random variables, , where measures, at time t, the aspect of the system which is of interest. For example, it might be the number of customers in a queue at times. As time passes, customers will arrive and leave, and so the value of will change. At any time , it takes one of the values 0, 1, 2,...; and can be any value in a subset of the infinite past to the infinite future.

In this workshop, we will talk about a variety of stochastic process models, and give their definitions. We will discuss the underlying assumptions and theory for the models. Then we will then explore what types of problems they solve for and practical applications where they are used. This course will cover the following stochastic process models, Markov Chain, Random Walk, Poisson Process, Birth-and-Death Process, Branching Process, and Brownian Motion.

The workshop is designed to be hands-on. Participants are required to bring laptops and be ready to write R, analyze data and interpret results. For each model, we present an example with a complete R code, and then an exercise to work on. Workshop participants do not need to be experts in R, the exercises generally require you to run a few functions that are given in the example problem.

The material covered by the workshop will be taken from my recently published book [Stochastic Processes with R](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09PVF4X8C), CRC Press, 2022.

**Biography of Dr. Olga Korosteleva**

Dr. Olga Korosteleva, is a professor of Statistics at the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at California State University, Long Beach (CSULB). She received her Bachelor’s degree in Mathematics in 1996 from Wayne State University in Detroit, and a Ph.D. in Statistics from Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana, in 2002. Since then she has been teaching mostly Statistics courses in the Master’s program in Applied Statistics at CSULB, and loving it!

Dr. Olga is an undergraduate advisor for students majoring in Mathematics with an option in Statistics. She is also the faculty supervisor for the Statistics Student Association. She is also the immediate past-president of the Southern California Chapter of the American Statistical Association (SCASA). Dr. Olga is the editor-in-chief of SCASA’s monthly eNewsletter and the author (co-author) of five statistical books.
