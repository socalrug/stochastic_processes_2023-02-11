Hello:

You are getting this email because you have signed up for the SoCal RUG - Introduction to Stochastic Processes course on Saturday 2023-02-11.

There are a number of things that you should do before the course to get the most out of it.

Setup

* Carefully read the README (https://github.com/socalrug/stochastic_processes_2023-02-11) file for the event.
* SoCal RUG is dedicated to providing a harassment-free environment. 
* Please read and abide by the SoCal RUG Code of Conduct (https://github.com/socalrug/stochastic_processes_2023-02-11/blob/main/code-of-conduct.md).
* We will be using slack.com (https://slack.com/) during the event.
* If you are not on the SoCal Slack workspace (https://tinyurl.com/socalrug-slack) please sign-up (https://tinyurl.com/socalrug-slack-invite2).
* Join the stochastic-2023 channel in slack. This is a great place to get help in getting set-up for the course.
* Information for the event is kept in the stochastic_processes_2023-02-11 (https://github.com/socalrug/stochastic_processes_2023-02-11/blob/main/code-of-conduct.md) GitHub repo.
* Install git (https://github.com/git-guides/install-git).
* Clone the event repo. Go to a command line terminal (Linux/Mac) or GitBash in Windows. Use the following command: 
git clone https://github.com/socalrug/stochastic_processes_2023-02-11.git
* Install R and optionally (but recommended) RStudio.
* Run the check_setup.r (https://github.com/socalrug/stochastic_processes_2023-02-11/blob/main/check_setup.r) script. It will make sure that you have the basic libraries installed and updated software. This can take quite a while to run.

If you are having issues with git or installing R or RStudio. See the README (https://github.com/socalrug/stochastic_processes_2023-02-11) for instructions on using the Posit Cloud.

Other Details

The event will be held at the Paul Merage School of Business at UC Irvine in building SB1. See the parking instructions (https://github.com/socalrug/stochastic_processes_2023-02-11/blob/main/parking/Parking%20and%20Building%20Location.pdf) and how to locate SB1.

Looking forward to seeing everyone there.
