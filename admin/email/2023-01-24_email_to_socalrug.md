# Introduction to Stochastic Processes Course

Hello SoCal RUG

Do not forget to sign up for the stats course on the [Eventbrite page](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/socal-rug-introduction-to-stochastic-processes-tickets-515333254637). You can get more details on the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/socalrug/stochastic_processes_2023-02-11) but in short the event is taking place on Saturday 11 February, 2023. Dr. Olga is going to introduce us to some really cool machine learning techniques. These techniques all have a component where the model uses random chance to learn. The course will cover the following model classes:  Markov Chain, Random Walk, Poisson Process, Birth-and-Death Process, Branching Process, and Brownian Motion. 

Bring your computer as we will be doing a small amount of coding. If you do not know R or you are not a good coder, do not worry about it. You will still get a tonne out of the course as the focus on how the models work and how to interpret the results. Plus, you get drinks, snacks, and lunch all for $10.
